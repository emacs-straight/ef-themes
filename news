Version 2.1.0 on 2026-01-27
═══════════════════════════

  This version introduces two carefully designed, legible and colourful
  themes: `ef-orange' (light) and `ef-fig' (dark). Both draw inspiration
  from the fruits they are name after.

  The convenience commands `ef-themes-select-dark' and
  `ef-themes-select-light' use the minibuffer to select+load an Ef theme
  that is either dark or light, respectively. The more general command
  is `ef-themes-select'.

  All screen shots of the themes are updated to reflect their current
  status: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures>.

  Remember that since version `2.0.0', the `ef-themes' are built on top
  of my `modus-themes'. This means that most of the changes happen to
  Modus and are inherited by Ef.


Version 2.0.0 on 2025-11-09
═══════════════════════════

  The Ef themes are now derived from my Modus themes. This means that
  they inherit the wide face coverage and extensive customisability of
  Modus, while retaining their stylistic flair.

  The Ef themes no longer provide any user options of their own. Each of
  the options we had before is now an alias for the Modus equivalent. As
  part of this transition, the Ef themes actually gain new customisation
  options, which are documented herein.

  Furthermore, the Ef themes do not define any commands to load a theme.
  What we had before is once again an alias for the equivalent Modus
  command.

  The manual of the Ef themes describes these compatibility
  arrangements. Further documentation and code samples are available in
  the manual of the Modus themes:

  Please read their respective documentation strings.

  If you use Ef and possibly other Modus derivatives, you may prefer to
  switch all your user options to the Modus ones. This way you can keep
  a unified configuration for all your themes.
