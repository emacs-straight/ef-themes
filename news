Version 2.0.0 on 2025-11-09
═══════════════════════════

  The Ef themes are now derived from my Modus themes. This means that
  they inherit the wide face coverage and extensive customisability of
  Modus, while retaining their stylistic flair.

  The Ef themes no longer provide any user options of their own. Each of
  the options we had before is now an alias for the Modus equivalent. As
  part of this transition, the Ef themes actually gain new customisation
  options, which are documented herein.

  Furthermore, the Ef themes do not define any commands to load a theme.
  What we had before is once again an alias for the equivalent Modus
  command.

  The manual of the Ef themes describes these compatibility
  arrangements. Further documentation and code samples are available in
  the manual of the Modus themes:

  Please read their respective documentation strings.

  If you use Ef and possibly other Modus derivatives, you may prefer to
  switch all your user options to the Modus ones. This way you can keep
  a unified configuration for all your themes.


Fewer bold and italic faces by default, more as an opt-in clause
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  In the past, the Ef themes did not provide an option to disable the
  extensive use of a bold font weight and italic font slant. Whereas now
  those are controlled by the user options
  `modus-themes-bold-constructs' and
  `modus-themes-italic-constructs'. By default, when they are `nil',
  bold and italics are used only when necessary. Set these user options
  to `t' to have bold and italics in more places.


Loading only Ef themes with the convenience wrappers we provide
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  All the old commands Ef provided for loading one of its themes will
  still work as before, meaning that they will only ever show and load a
  theme that belongs to the Ef collection.

  Internally, these commands are now using the Modus infrastructure and
  are then limiting the set of themes to the Ef collection. They are …
